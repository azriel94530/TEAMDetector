This is a repository for the image reconstruction and analysis code I have written for the TEAM detector.  There are two versions of the code here: one that uses ROOT to plot images and histograms and one that uses a bunch of native scipy fucntionality.  I did the ROOT version first (because I started out knowing ROOT a little better), and it is mainly included as a piece of legacy software.  The native scipy code is WAY faster (by a factor of about four or five) and has a bunch of added functionality for finding local maxima and clusters of hits.  The scipy functionality is best supplied by installing anaconda (https://www.continuum.io/why-anaconda).
