This is a repository for the image reconstruction and analysis code I have written for the TEAM detector.  Like the SpectroCCD tools repository, it is mostly written in python and needs to be able to talk to pyROOT.  The dependencies on other scipy and other packages that come with anaconda is less here since the output of the TEAM detector is a custom binary file and not a FITS image (i.e. no need for astropy...), but in my humble opinion, you should be running python code using anaconda instead of your system python regardless.
