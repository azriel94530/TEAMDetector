This is a repository for the image reconstruction and analysis code I have written for the TEAM detector.  There are two versions of the code here: one that uses ROOT to plot images and histograms and one that uses a bunch of native scipy fucntionality.  The ROOT version is a little more mature (because I know ROOT a little better), but the native scipy code is WAY faster (by a factor of about four or five).  The scipy functionality is best supplied by installing anaconda.
